Check the sale section!<br><br>This is the pencil skirt or pin-striped suit of our wallets…that impeccably tailored, polished look. This checkbook wallet will make people assume you read the WSJ while running your daily 10K before arriving at work at 6am. Sleek, long, thin wallet yet roomy enough to accommodate about 40 thick plastic cards, checkbook, and stretched out cash money plus coins. Our special \"divide &amp; conquer\" design breaks up your cards into 4 discrete areas so they don't all stagger on one long row leaving huge lumps. Our designed breakup into 4 general areas means there will be very nice symmetry when your cards are in place and the wallet is shut so you'll have an even, flattish plane rather than \"staggered bulges\" like all those other outdated thick regular wallets. Two discrete billfold sized compartments enable separation between cash, receipts, checkbook, or even differing currencies for travelers. Two ID pockets allow for double identities or that special photo. Both ID pockets feature our easy access thumb-activated hole for quick and easy card in and out. Snaps securely shut, and features an extra-long coin compartment on the outside for easy access. Unisex, and sleek enough for men's or women's jacket pockets, briefcases, laptop bags or switching to and from purses. Magnetic snap for an elegant opening and closing wallet experience.
